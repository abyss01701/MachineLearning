# MachineLearning

This project used the Pandas and Scikit-learn frameworks for constructing the model. Jupyter was used as an open source notebook with the help of anaconda to run the model.

1. We first launched Jupyter on Anaconda by using the command: `jupyter notebook`. This will run Jupyter on port 8888 of your local machine.
